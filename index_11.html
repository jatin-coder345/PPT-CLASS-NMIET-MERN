<h2>About ratha yatra</h2>
<p>The Puri Ratha Yatra, also known as the Chariot Festival, is one of the most spectacular and spiritually significant festivals in India. Celebrated annually in the holy city of Puri, Odisha, it marks the grand journey of Lord Jagannath, along with his siblings Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra, from the Jagannath Temple to the Gundicha Temple, their aunt's abode, located about 3 kilometers away. The deities are placed on massive, beautifully decorated wooden chariots pulled by thousands of devotees amidst chants, music, and a sea of spiritual fervor. This event symbolizes the Lord's willingness to come out and give darshan to all, including those who cannot enter the temple. The Ratha Yatra attracts millions of pilgrims and tourists from around the world, making it not just a religious celebration but a vibrant display of culture, devotion, and unity.</p>
